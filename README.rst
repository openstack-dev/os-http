os-http
===============================

Simple HTTP CLI for OpenStack

A common problem I have in development is needing to make a request against an
authenticated request against an OpenStack API "correctly" (using the catalog,
real authentication, version discovery etc).

os-http is a httpie_ inspired wrapper around basic keystoneauth_ functionality
that can make and display the response to HTTP requests against openstack
services.
